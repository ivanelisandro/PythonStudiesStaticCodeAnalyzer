<p>Paul has written a program which splits a paragraph into sentences and prints the result. However, it doesn't work properly. Fix the code below to make it work. Keep in mind that there shouldn't be any punctuation signs in the end of the output sentences. </p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there. It really didn&#39;t make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope. He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door. He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door. He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did.</code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">He hid under the covers hoping that nobody would notice him there<br>It really didn&#39;t make much sense since it would be obvious to anyone who walked into the room there was someone hiding there, but he still held out hope<br>He heard footsteps coming down the hall and stop in front in front of the bedroom door<br>He heard the squeak of the door hinges and someone opened the bedroom door<br>He held his breath waiting for whoever was about to discover him, but they never did</code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 15 seconds</font><br><br>
